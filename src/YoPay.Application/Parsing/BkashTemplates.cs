/// The bKash patterns, written against real messages collected from a live account
/// between July and September 2026.
///
/// Read the ordering rule before adding one: templates are tried in order and the first
/// match wins, so the messages that must never be mistaken for a payment are listed
/// first. An OTP message contains the words "PAYMENT" and an amount; a credit pattern
/// that ran before the OTP pattern could plausibly match it, and the cost of that
/// mistake is an order shipped for money that never arrived.
///
/// Known gap: every credit pattern here comes from a personal account. The wording bKash
/// sends to a merchant or retail account when a customer pays it has not been captured
/// yet, and that is the single most important message in this product. It has to come
/// from a real merchant-account handset during the T0A spike before the pilot.

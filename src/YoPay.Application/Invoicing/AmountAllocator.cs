/// The salt goes upward, never downward. Either direction makes the figure unambiguous,

/// you two taka less" is a conversation nobody wants to have with their accountant. The
/// customer is shown the charged figure and nothing else, so there is no surprise either
/// way.
///
/// The ceiling scales with the invoice: five taka on top of a five thousand taka order is
/// noise, five taka on a fifty taka order is a ten percent surcharge. That deliberately
/// leaves small invoices with very few distinct slots - a fifty taka invoice gets two -
/// which is a real capacity limit, not an oversight. When the slots run out the answer is
/// to fall back to the transaction id flow, not to widen the salt until the number stops
/// resembling the price.
